### Building

To run the build script:

1. install **NAnt** from [here](http://nant.sourceforge.net/).
2. open a command window where the default.build file is.
3. run ```> nant```

Note: To clean the build run ```> nant clean```. By default running NAnt without arguments runs the runProgram command.
You can clean and run the program by chaining the commands ```> nant clean runProgram```
